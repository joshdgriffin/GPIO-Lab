# Submission Instructions

Welcome to your ENGR4230 assignment! We will be using this repository for you to submit your programming assignments and for me to provide feedback on your assignments. To submit your assignment, please do the following:

1. Upload all of the .c and/or .h files that you wrote in your Code Composer Studio Project folder.
2. Click "Commit" to submit your project for grading.

A pull request will be automatically generated that will allow me to comment on your code. Do not close or edit the pull request unless I ask you to do so.
